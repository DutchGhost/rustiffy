# rustiffy
Zig FFI with Rust

This is a project grown out of curiosity in Rust and Zig. The idea is to make Zig interact with Rust code. This works, because both languages have the ability to make use of C FFI.

The name `rustiffy` is a combination of `rust` and `FFI`.

The counterpart, `zigiffy` also exists: [zigiffy](https://github.com/DutchGhost/zigiffy)
